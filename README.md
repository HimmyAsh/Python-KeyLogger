<b>This is for educational purposes only, do not use this in any malcious manner.</b>

This keylogger is a simple python code that you can test in a safe secure environment. 
The logger when executed will check for a directory specified by the user and will create a log file showing all keys pressed.

Further implmentations of this attack, malicious actors will have this tied back to a secured database of their own and have all the logs stored away.
This allows them to track each website you go to and dissect the keys into your typed usernames and passwords.
